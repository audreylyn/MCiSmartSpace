# mcismartspace

## Description

mcismartspace is a comprehensive web application designed for managing room reservations, equipment tracking, and user administration in academic environments. The system supports role-based access control across multiple user types including students, teachers, department administrators, and registrar staff. Key features include QR code-based room check-ins, equipment issue reporting with file uploads, PDF generation for reports, and a responsive interface that adapts to different screen sizes and user roles.

## Interesting Techniques

The codebase employs several modern web development patterns. The application uses [Flexbox layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) extensively for responsive design, combined with [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for complex layouts. Client-side PDF generation is handled through browser APIs without server processing. The QR code functionality integrates both the [Barcode Detection API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API) where supported and fallback JavaScript libraries. File uploads utilize [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) with progress tracking and validation. The interface implements [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) for consistent theming across different user role interfaces.

## Notable Technologies & Libraries

The application integrates several established libraries and frameworks. [Bootstrap 4.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/) provides the responsive grid system and UI components. [Font Awesome 4.5.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) supplies the icon system throughout the interface. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) handles DOM manipulation and AJAX interactions. [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) powers the sortable, searchable data grids. The QR code functionality uses [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) for generation and [HTML5-QRCode](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode) for scanning. [PHPSpreadsheet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet) manages Excel file imports and exports. The PHP backend utilizes [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) for environment configuration management.

Typography uses [Plus Jakarta Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plus+Jakarta+Sans) from Google Fonts. Performance optimizations include [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) for mobile interaction improvements and [Malihu Custom Scrollbar](https://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/) for enhanced scrolling experiences.

```

The authentication system resides in the `auth/` directory, handling session management and role-based access control. Each user role maintains its own directory structure with dedicated includes and public assets. The `partials/` directory contains shared PHP components like headers, navigation, and footers that are reused across different user interfaces. File uploads are organized in the `uploads/` directory with subdirectories for equipment issue attachments and temporary QR code images. The `vendors/` directory houses third-party frontend libraries, while `vendor/` contains Composer-managed PHP dependencies.
